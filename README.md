# rotation.py
the BGT rotation script converted to python
## disclaimer
I do not own this script, nor I want to claim it as my own. I uploaded this script so that everyone can use it as their needs.
I've got authorizations from the owners.
## usage
The functions are the same as the rotation in BGT, so just follow that readme.
